    <div id="Lily-Rosemary-and-the-Jack-of-Hearts"></div><h1>Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts<br />莉莉，萝丝玛丽和红心杰克</h1>
</center>
<p><br /><p align="center">The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall<br>
The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall<br>
The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down<br>
Anyone with any sense had already left town<br>
He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />庆典结束了，小伙子们打算大干一场<br>
卡巴莱歌舞厅静悄悄，只有墙里的钻头在响<br>
宵禁解除，轮盘赌也打了烊<br>
任何还有理智的人都早已离开了镇上<br>
此时他就站在门廊，看起来像是红心杰克一样<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />He moved across the mirrored room, &quot;Set it up for everyone,&quot; he said<br>
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads<br>
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin<br>
&quot;Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?&quot;<br>
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />他穿过带镜子的房间，「给每个人都安排好，」他说<br>
所有人转回头去，继续开始做起各自先前在做的事<br>
接着他走向一名陌生人，咧嘴笑着问<br>
「可否劳烦你告诉我，朋友，演出什么时候开始？」<br>
然后他挪到角落，低下了脸，就像是红心杰克翻过了面<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs<br>
Lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair<br>
Outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide<br>
A gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside<br>
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />后台的姑娘们靠在楼梯旁玩着梭哈<br>
莉莉手里有两张皇后，她在等待第三张来配这一对牌<br>
此时外面的街道人如潮涌，窗户大开<br>
在屋内也能感觉到，有一阵微风吹来<br>
莉莉又叫了一次注，结果把红心杰克抽了上来<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine<br>
He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine<br>
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place<br>
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste<br>
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />大吉姆可不是任人愚弄的傻瓜，他坐拥着镇上唯一的钻石矿<br>
他同往日一般入场，造型时髦，风格华丽<br>
带着保镖，手持银杖，他的头发丝丝分明<br>
他总是肆意索取，同时又铺张扬厉<br>
可他的保镖和银杖都不能与红心杰克相比<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town<br>
She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown<br>
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear<br>
&quot;Sorry, darlin', that I'm late,&quot; but he didn't seem to hear<br>
He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />萝丝玛丽梳妆妥当，坐着马车来到镇上<br>
她从侧门溜进场，看上去就像是无冕的皇后一样<br>
她眨动睫毛，在他耳边轻声说道<br>
「抱歉，亲爱的，我来晚了，」可似乎他没有听到<br>
他的目光正注视红心杰克所在的地方<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />&quot;I know I've seen that face somewhere,&quot; Big Jim was thinkin' to himself<br>
&quot;Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf&quot;<br>
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim<br>
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him<br>
Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />「我肯定在哪儿见过那张脸，」大吉姆自顾自地想着<br>
「或许是在墨西哥吧，又或许是在某人架子上的相片」<br>
可此时人们开始跺脚，室内的灯光变得昏暗<br>
屋子里一片漆黑中只有大吉姆和他<br>
注视着那只蝴蝶，是她刚才抽到了红心杰克的牌<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child<br>
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled<br>
She'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs<br>
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere<br>
But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />莉莉是位公主，她皮肤皙白，如孩童般受人喜爱<br>
她做了一切不得不做的事，每当她微笑时，都会展现出那种特有的神采<br>
她出逃自一个破碎的家庭，经历过各类风流韵事<br>
认识过各行各业的男人，他们带她去过各种地方<br>
但她从未遇到过谁能像红心杰克那样<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined<br>
The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind<br>
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring<br>
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king<br>
No, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />谁都没注意到绞刑法官走了进来，他正在大吃大喝<br>
墙里的钻头还在响，可似乎没人把它放在心上<br>
莉莉手上持有吉姆给的戒指，这件事人尽皆知<br>
至于莉莉和国王的关系，也不会被任何事情破坏<br>
不，不会被任何事情破坏，可也许红心杰克除外<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife<br>
She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife<br>
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide<br>
Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died<br>
She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />萝丝玛丽开始酗酒，她看着自己在小刀上的倒影<br>
她厌倦了人们的关注，厌倦了扮演大吉姆妻子的角色<br>
她做过许多糟糕的事情，甚至有次还试过自杀<br>
如今她只想在自己死前，再完成最后一桩善举<br>
她凝视着未来，把全部的希望压在了红心杰克身上<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away<br>
&quot;Has your luck run out?&quot; she laughed at him, &quot;Well, I guess you must have known it would someday<br>
Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint<br>
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint&quot;<br>
Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />莉莉洗下脸上的妆，脱下裙子，埋到一旁<br>
「你的运气用完了么？」她笑道，「好吧，我猜你一定知道会有这一天的<br>
当心，别碰到墙，新涂的油漆还没干呢<br>
真高兴见到活生生的你，你看起来像个圣徒似的」<br>
此时有脚步声在走廊响起，直奔红心杰克而来<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair<br>
&quot;There's something funny going on,&quot; he said, &quot;I can just feel it in the air&quot;<br>
He went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk<br>
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk<br>
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />后台经理正绕着他的椅子来回踱步<br>
「有什么蹊跷的事情发生了，」他说，「我就是隐约有这种感觉」<br>
他跑去找绞刑法官，可绞刑法官醉得不省人事<br>
此时主演身着僧侣服，从一旁迅速经过<br>
无论是什么地方，都不会再有比红心杰克更好的演员<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Lily's arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch<br>
She forgot all about the man she couldn't stand who hounded her so much<br>
&quot;I've missed you so,&quot; she said to him, and he felt she was sincere<br>
But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear<br>
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />莉莉的双臂紧紧环绕着她深爱的男人<br>
她完全忘记了另一个男人，纠缠不清，让她忍无可忍<br>
「我好想你，」她对他说，他感受到了她的真诚<br>
可隔在门外的事让他心生恐惧与嫉恨<br>
只不过是人生中又一个夜晚，对于红心杰克而言<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick<br>
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked<br>
And Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised<br>
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes<br>
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />没人搞得清楚状况，但他们都说一切发生得很快<br>
试衣间的门被撞开，冰冷的左轮手枪咔哒一响<br>
大吉姆就站在那里，说是意外倒也谈不上<br>
萝丝玛丽在他身旁，眼里露出镇定的目光<br>
她跟随着大吉姆，可红心杰克才是叫她偏心的对象<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall<br>
And cleaned out the bank safe, it's said that they got off with quite a haul<br>
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground<br>
For one more member who had business back in town<br>
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />两扇门后的小伙子们终于打通了墙<br>
他们洗劫了银行保险箱，据说卷走了一大笔钱<br>
他们在等人，待在了漆黑的河床边<br>
只因还有一位成员，由于某些事仍留在镇上<br>
而要是离了红心杰克，他们根本走不了多远<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />The next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black<br>
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back<br>
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink<br>
The hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink<br>
The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />第二天是绞刑日，天气阴郁，一片灰冷<br>
躺倒的大吉姆被盖了起来，他被背后的一把小刀刺杀<br>
萝丝玛丽登上了绞刑架，她眼睛都没眨一下<br>
绞刑法官醒了酒，他今天什么也没喝<br>
刑场上唯一缺少的，就是红心杰克的身影<br>
<br />❍<br /><br />The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, &quot;Closed for repair&quot;<br>
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair<br>
She was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw<br>
Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law<br>
But most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts<br>
<br />如今卡巴莱歌舞厅空无一人，标牌上写着「停业维修」<br>
莉莉也已把头发上的染料洗净<br>
她想着自己的父亲，那个她几乎不怎么见到的人<br>
她想着萝丝玛丽，还想着法律<br>
但红心杰克才是她想的最多的那个人<br>
